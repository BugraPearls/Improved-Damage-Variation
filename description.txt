Simple put, this Mod allows for far better damage variation compared to Vanilla, Increases range of possible damages greatly without changing the % of variation and luck over 1 (100%) allows the code to re-roll the variation, rather than capping it at 1 (100%) luck.

If you're interested in further details;

This mod modifies how damage variation is calculated and changes following things:
1. Damage Variation percentage is now calculated with Float values, so it doesn't go 15%, 14%, 13%, 12%... etc., but rather can be ANY decimal number between 15% and -15% by default.
2. Luck over 100% (1f) can re-roll again (not capped to anything, you can even put 50f luck to have it rolled 50 times.) to try to get a higher value.
3. End result damage rounding is replaced with a randomizer; Which first takes out integral part of the decimal value, and proceeds to roll a chance to get +1 or -1 with the remaining decimal value.

What does the changes above & this Mod accomplish?
1. Allows for better randomization, allowing you to have way more damage variation, especially with higher damage numbers. (Example: In vanilla, 1000 damage could go between 850 - 1150 damage, but only with multiplications of 10 (so only up to 30 variations), with this mod it can go up +1, being able to get numbers like 954 or 1028.)
2. Makes any luck value over 1f not useless.
3. Normally Vanilla directly rounds the number to nearest integral value, this Mod makes it so any value over the integral amount has that chance to be rolled +1 or -1. (Example: Damage Variation returns 20.283 damage, vanilla code would ALWAYS say: this is 20 damage. This mod makes it so its 20, but with 28.3% chance, it becomes 21.)
4. Due to whats mentioned above; This Mod allows for higher damage variation range possible for some cases, compared to Vanilla. Although this can be usually noticed with low damage numbers. (Example: 9 damage with vanilla cannot get either 7 or 11 damage. This mod allows that.)

Should be compatible with 99.99% of Vanilla. If a Mod is not using Vanilla Damage Variation, this mod will do nothing for that. Most Mods use it, so it should be completely fine.
